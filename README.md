# pig-dice-game
Welcome. This is a simple dice game named Pig. The game, like the UI, is simple. Player 1 initially starts the game and rolls the dice by clicking "ROLL". A player may continue 
to keep taking risks by continuing to roll the die and accumulating points held in the "CURRENT" section. However, if a player rolls a "1", all those points will reset to "0"
and the it will now be Player 2 turn. On the other hand, a player has the option to click "HOLD" to add their points to their score but will also affectively end their turn. 
These points cannot be taken away when a "1" is rolled. The first player to reach 100 wins. Enjoy!
